# Housing Price Insights: Boston MA - U.S. Census Service Data

## Project Overview

This project provides insights on housing prices in Boston, MA, using a dataset derived from the U.S. Census Service. The goal is to analyze the data and present findings that will help upper management make informed decisions on key aspects related to housing prices.

The analysis will answer the following questions:

1. **Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles River or not?**
2. **Is there a difference in median values of houses of each proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?**
3. **Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric Oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?**
4. **What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centers on the median value of owner-occupied homes?**
